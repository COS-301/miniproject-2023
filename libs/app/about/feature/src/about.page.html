      Lapse is a social media app that puts the focus back on creating and
      sharing high-quality content. With a time limit to use the app, users
      are encouraged to make the most of their time and not get lost in
      endless scrolling. The time limit can increase based on engagements made
      on their posts, as well as a daily login reward.

      But that's not all. Lapse also incentivizes high-quality content by
      allowing users to buy other posts for a certain price and earn a
      kickback on the engagement their purchase receives. This creates a
      community of creators and curators, where everyone benefits from great
      content.

    <div class="textContent">
      So if you're tired of aimlessly scrolling and want to make the most of
      your time on social media, join Lapse and start creating and sharing
      content that truly stands out.
